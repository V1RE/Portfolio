A JAM-Stack is basically a static website which is rendered at deploy time, this means that hosting a website only requires a basic CDN, which is way cheaper than renting a server to generate each and every page on the fly. Another big advantage is the performance aspect, no gaint JavaScript files which slow down your browsing experience. The last advantage is the small attack surface since there is no way to inject any code.
